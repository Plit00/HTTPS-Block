SHA-1 Algorithm example<br>

  * <code> SHA1("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
= 2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12</code>

* <code>SHA1("") = da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</code>

Let's to see How hack HTTPS

Why block Government  https ip?<br>
Peoples do illegal performance.
Block to ip 1.1.1.1 and we don't set in https://[URL]<br>

IP Address Blocking
--
1.Avoiding Address Blocking<br>
* Proxy servers and other methods can be used to bypass the blocking of traffic from IP addresses. However, anti-proxy strategies are available.

2.Proxy & Anti-Proxy<br>
  ![proxy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Proxy_concept_en.svg/400px-Proxy_concept_en.svg.png)(proxy/wiki)

* In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.

3.Web Proxy
* Web proxies forward HTTP requests. The request from the client is the same as a regular HTTP request except the full URL is passed, instead of just the path


* Proxy-Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials<br>
Accept: text/html<br>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>
Content-Type: text/html; charset UTF-8<br>

* Use Apache Sever

4.DNS Proxy
* A DNS proxy server takes DNS queries from a (usually local) network and forwards them to an Internet Domain Name Server. It may also cache DNS records.

DNS Spoofing
--
A type of computer attack wherein a user is forced to navigate to a fake website disguised to look like a real one, with the intention of diverting traffic or stealing credentials of the users.
