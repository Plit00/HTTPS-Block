IP Address Blocking

1.Avoiding Address Blocking<br>
* Proxy servers and other methods can be used to bypass the blocking of traffic from IP addresses. However, anti-proxy strategies are available.

* In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.

3.Web Proxy
* Web proxies forward HTTP requests. The request from the client is the same as a regular HTTP request except the full URL is passed, instead of just the path


* Proxy-Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials<br>
Accept: text/html<br>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>
Content-Type: text/html; charset UTF-8<br>

* Use Apache Sever

4.DNS Proxy
* A DNS proxy server takes DNS queries from a (usually local) network and forwards them to an Internet Domain Name Server. It may also cache DNS records.
